# RedRediSearch

  RedRediSearch is a Node.js wrapper library for the [RediSearch](http://redisearch.io/) Redis module. It is more-or-less syntactically compatible with [Reds](https://github.com/tj/reds), another Node.js search library. RedRediSearch and RediSearch can provide full-text searching that is much faster than the original Reds library (see Benchmarks).
  
   
## Upgrading

If you are upgrading from Reds, you'll need to make your `createSearch` asynchronous and re-index your data. Otherwise, your app-level logic and code should be compatible.

## Installation

      $ npm install redredisearch

## Example

The first thing you'll want to do is create a `Search` instance, which allows you to pass a `key`, used for namespacing within RediSearch so that you may have several searches in the same Redis database. You may specify your own [node_redis](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis) instance with the `redredisearch.setClient` function.

```js
var search = redredisearch.createSearch('pets',{}, function(err, search) {
  /* ... */
});
```

You can then add items to the index with the `Search#index` function.

```js
var strs = [];
strs.push('Tobi wants four dollars');
strs.push('Tobi only wants $4');
strs.push('Loki is really fat');
strs.push('Loki, Jane, and Tobi are ferrets');
strs.push('Manny is a cat');
strs.push('Luna is a cat');
strs.push('Mustachio is a cat');

var search = redredisearch.createSearch('pets',{}, function(err,search) {
  strs.forEach(function(str, i){ search.index(str, i); });
});
```

 To perform a query against the index simply invoke `Search#query()` with a string, and pass a callback, which receives an array of ids when present, or an empty array otherwise.

```js
search
  .query(query = 'Tobi dollars')
  .end(function(err, ids){
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('Search results for "%s":', query);
    ids.forEach(function(id){
      console.log('  - %s', strs[id]);
    });
    process.exit();
  });
  ```

 By default, queries are an intersection of the search words. The previous example would yield the following output since only one string contains both "Tobi" _and_ "dollars":

```
Search results for "Tobi dollars":
  - Tobi wants four dollars
```

 We can tweak the query to perform a union by passing either "union" or "or" to `Search#type()` in `redredisearch.search()` between `Search#query()` and `Search#end()`, indicating that _any_ of the constants computed may be present for the `id` to match.

```js
search
  .query('tobi dollars')
  .type('or')
  .end(function(err, ids){
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('Search results for "%s":', query);
    ids.forEach(function(id){
      console.log('  - %s', strs[id]);
    });
  });
```

 The union search would yield the following since three strings contain either "Tobi" _or_ "dollars":

```
Search results for "tobi dollars":
  - Tobi wants four dollars
  - Tobi only wants $4
  - Loki, Jane, and Tobi are ferrets
```

RediSearch has an advanced query syntax that can be used by using the 'direct' search type. See the [RediSearch documentation](http://redisearch.io/Query_Syntax/) for this syntax.

```js
search
  .query('(hello|hella) (world|werld)')
  .type('direct')
  .end(function(err, ids){
    /* ... */
  });
```

Also included in the package is the RediSearch Suggestion API. This has no corollary in the Reds module. The Suggestion API is ideal for auto-complete type situations and is entirely separate from the Search API. 

```js
var suggestions = redredisearch.suggestion('my-suggestion-list');

suggestions.add(
  'redis',                                            // add 'redis'
  2,                                                  // with a 'score' of 2, this affects the position in the results, higher = higher up in results
  function(err,sizeOfSuggestionList) { /* ... */ }    // callback
);
suggestions.add(
  'redisearch',                                       
  5,
  function(err,sizeOfSuggestionList) { /* ... */ } 
);
suggestions.add(
  'reds',                                       
  1,
  function(err,sizeOfSuggestionList) { /* ... */ } 
);

/* ... */

sugggestions.get(
  're',                                               // prefix - will find anything starting with "re"
  function(err, returnedSuggestions) {
    /* returnedSuggestions is set to [ "redisearch", "redis", "reds" ] */
  }
);

sugggestions.get(
  'redis',                                            // prefix - will find anything starting with "redis", so not "reds"
  function(err, returnedSuggestions) {
    /* returnedSuggestions is set to [ "redisearch", "redis" ] */
  }
)
```

There is also a `fuzzy` opt and `maxResults` that can either be set by chaining or by passing an object in the second argument in the constructor.


## API

```js
redredisearch.createSearch(key, options, fn) : Search
redredisearch.setClient(inClient)
redredisearch.createClient()
redredisearch.confirmModule(cb)
redredisearch.words(str) : Array
redredisearch.suggestionList(key,opts) : Suggestion
Search#index(text, id[, fn])
Search#remove(id[, fn]);
Search#query(text, fn[, type]) : Query
Query#type(type)
Query#between(str)
Query#end(fn)
Suggestion#fuzzy(isFuzzy)
Suggestion#maxResults(maxResults)
Suggestion#add(str,score,fn)
Suggestion#get(prefix,fn)
Suggestion#del(str,fn)

```

 Examples:

```js
var search = redredisearch.createSearch('misc');
search.index('Foo bar baz', 'abc');
search.index('Foo bar', 'bcd');
search.remove('bcd');
search.query('foo bar').end(function(err, ids){});
```


## Benchmarks

When compared to Reds, RedRediSearch is much faster at indexing and somewhat faster at query:

_Indexing - documents / second_

| Module         | Tiny | Small | Medium | Large |
|----------------|------|-------|--------|-------|
| Reds           | 122  | 75    | 10     |  0    |
| RediRediSearch | 1,256| 501   | 132    |  5    |

_Query - queries / second_

| Module         | 1 term | 2 terms / AND | 2 terms / OR | 3 terms / AND | 3 terms / OR | Long* / AND | Long* / OR | 
|----------------|--------|---------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|------------|----------|
| Reds           | 8,754  | 8,765         | 8,389        | 7,622         | 7,193        | 1,649      | 1,647 |
| RedRediSearch  | 10,955 | 12,945        | 10,054       | 12,769        | 8,389        | 6,456      | 12,311 |

The "Long" query string is taken from the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: "Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms: (a) freedom of conscience and religion;  (b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication; (c) freedom of peaceful assembly; and (d) freedom of association." (Used because I just had it open in another tab...)
